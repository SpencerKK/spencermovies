# Spencer Movies 

- **[Live Demo](https://spencerkk.github.io/spencermovies/#/)** 

This React / Redux project is a movie browsing site whose design was influenced by the [lookmovie](https://lookmovie.ag/) layout. It makes fetch requests to several endpoints on [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US) API before displaying the results to the user. TV titles will display related TV titles and Movie titles will display related movie titles.
